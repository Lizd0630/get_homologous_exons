# get_homologous_exons
This repository contains programs to extract homologous exons based on
sequence alignments and the exon-intron structure information.

Two types of sequence alignments can be used for this purpose:
1. alignments of protein-coding sequences of homologous genes.
2. alignments of whole-genome sequences.

The difference by using these two types of alignments are being
determined and will upload it here later.

At present, only the program for using protein-coding sequence
alignments is ready.

Your feedback is welcome!
